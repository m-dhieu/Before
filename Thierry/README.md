# Task

## Frontend Dashboard Development
Build a web-based dashboard using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
Include filtering and sorting options (e.g., by time, distance, location, fare)  
Enable dynamic interaction with the data (e.g., visual summaries, detail views)

### Note
The dashboard should allow users to explore urban mobility patterns and draw meaningful insights.  
You are not told what to visualize. It is your responsibility to explore the dataset and decide what is insightful or useful.  
Original, well-justified visualization choices will be rewarded.
